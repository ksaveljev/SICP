I have recently found out about MIT book ["Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) which is said to be one of those books every programmer should take a look at.

It feels like a good opportunity to learn Scheme whilst solving lots of small interesting problems given in the book. Using [MIT-Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) which is easily obtainable on Linux distributions (in my case from AUR on Arch Linux).

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the above mentioned book. I just hope I have enough willpower to finish them all.
